# Google Summer of Code projects under .NET Foundation

[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is a program that offers student developers stipends to write code for various open source projects. Google will be working with several open source, free software, and technology-related groups to identify and fund several projects over a three month period.

Please note that to apply for GSoC, you will need to go through the [standard Google Summer of Code application process](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), selecting .NET Foundation as the organization. Any questions or comments about this program can be sent to soc@dotnetfoundation.com.

Our framework project ideas fall under three top categories this year:
 * [ASP.NET](/projects/aspnet.md)
 * [Framework](/projects/framework.md)
 * [Docs](/projects/docs.md)
 * [Templating](/projects/templating.md)

Additionally, the following community project(s) under .NET Foundation are available:
 * [Open Live Writer](project/community/open-live-writer.md)
