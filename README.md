# Google Summer of Code projects under .NET Foundation

[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is a program that offers student developers stipends to write code for various open source projects. Google will be working with several open source, free software, and technology-related groups to identify and fund several projects over a three month period.

Please note that to apply for GSoC, you will need to go through the [standard Google Summer of Code application process](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), selecting .NET Foundation as the organization. Any questions or comments about this program can be sent to soc@dotnetfoundation.com.

Our project ideas fall under three top categories this year:
 * [ASP.NET](/projects/aspnet.md)
 * [Docs](/projects/docs.md)
 * [Templating](/projects/docs.md)
